# Open-Security-Protocols
Best Security practices for anyone cautious about their privacy to remain secure on the internet.

## Mobile Security
### Search Engines

- On mobile, don't use proprietary search engines such as `Google Chrome`.
- Instead, you shoud install and use `DuckDuckGo` as your primary search engine.
- It's available on all mobile platforms.

### Setting up DuckDuckGo
---

- [x] After installing the app, perform the following changes.
- [x] Enable `App Tracking Protection` globally, this will block tracking requests on your apps.
- [x] Enable delete history and cookies on app closed.
- [x] Set up your `@duck.com` email address to mask you real email addresses, this will remove trackers that are normally added to your emails. Emails will be sent and received with your actual email.
- [x] Disable search suggestions if you hate it.

### VPN and AD Blocking
---

- For the case of using a VPN, I strongly condemn using a VPN that you don't own, this means that you need to run your own `private VPN` that you have control over.
- A majority of VPN's actually do track you almost all the time.
- They claim that they do not keep any logs yet some of them do keep logs and even submit them to law enforcement if they are summoned to do so.
- I will talk about how you can set up one and be able to connect it from anywhere.
