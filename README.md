# Open-Security-Protocols
Best Security practices for anyone cautious about their privacy to remain secure on the internet.

## Mobile Security
### Search Engines

- On mobile, don't use proprietary search engines such as `Google Chrome`.
- Instead, you shoud install and use `DuckDuckGo` as your primary search engine.
- It's available on all mobile platforms.

### Setting up DuckDuckGo
---

- [x] After installing the app, perform the following changes.
- [x] Enable `App Tracking Protection` globally, this will block tracking requests on your apps.
- [x] Enable delete history and cookies on app closed.
- [x] Set up your `@duck.com` email address to mask you real email addresses, this will remove trackers that are normally added to your emails. Emails will be sent and received with your actual email.
- [x] Disable search suggestions if you hate it.

---

### VPN and AD Blocking
---

- For the case of using a VPN, I strongly condemn using a VPN that you don't own, this means that you need to run your own `private VPN` that you have control over.
- A majority of VPN's actually do track you almost all the time.
- They claim that they do not keep any logs yet some of them do keep logs and even submit them to law enforcement if they are summoned to do so.
- I will talk about how you can set up one and be able to connect it from anywhere.
- What we are going to set up here is a service that combines a `VPN`, a `DNS service` and an `AD blocker` all in one.
- This will be a bit technical but its worth it.

---

### Setting up the Service
---

- [x] You first need to get a `virtual machine`, preferably on any Cloud provider of your choice.
- [x] You don't need to pay for the machine since a majority of the providers always have services that are free forever. In this case, we will use `Oracle Cloud`.
- [x] Sign Up on the platform.
- [x] Select a region where you want it to be provisioned then proceed to spin up a virtual machine that is `free forever`.
- [x] This will come with `1GB RAM` and `1 CPU`. This should be enough for personal use.
- [x] Choose `Ubuntu` as your OS since it easier to set up on this one.
- [x] Ensure that you have generated an `SSH Public key and Private key pair` then add the public key during the set up process.
```bash
    ssh-keygen
```
- [x] On networking, open port `51820` for `UDP`.
- [x] Once it has been provisioned, grab its IP address then SSH into it.
- [x] Should be something like this.
```bash
    ssh ubuntu@<machine-ip-address>
```
- [x] Go ahead and update packages.
```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
- [x] Once done, proceed to install `Docker` and `Docker Compose`.
- [x] You should follow the guide here to do that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/).
- [x] To make things easier, we are going to use an already existing packaged docker file containing all the three services.

---

### Installing the tools
---

- [x] The packaged container is called `wirehole`. A combination of `wireguard`, `unbound` and `pihole`.
- [x] To install it, do the following.
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IAmStoxe/wirehole.git
```
- [x] Go to the folder containing Wirehole.
```bash
    cd wirehole
```
- [x] Start the service.
```bash
    sudo docker compose up -d
```
- [x] Once the service has started, get the id of wirehole by running.
```bash
    sudo docker ps
```
- [x] Once you have obtained its id, then get its logs.
```bash
    sudo docker logs <wirehole-id>
```
- [x] You should be able to see a `QR Code`.
- [x] With this QR Code, you should be able to connect to this service from your mobile phone.
- [x] To connect to it, simply install the `Wireguard` app then scan the QR Code.
- [x] You are connected to the service successfully.
- [x] Now you are using your own `VPN` and `AD Blocker`.

## PC and Laptop Security

- Before setting up security measures on your `PC or Laptop`, I recommend that you be running `Linux` as your primary, at least since its a little more secure than your regular `Windows` or `Mac` OS.

### Browser Security

- There are a couple of multiple browsers that are secure that you can use.
- [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/), a Firefox fork that has been stripped down.
- [Brave](https://brave.com/), a Chromium based browser that has been stripped down.
- I will focus majorly on `LibreWolf`.

### Setting up LibreWolf
---

- [x] After installing LibreWolf, we need to do some tweaks to further harden security aside from its defaults.
- [x] In settings, disable `Remember browsing and download history`.
- [x] Enable `Clear history when LibreWolf` closes.
- [x] Diable `browsing_history` on Address Bar.
- [x] Once you have set up all that, you will want to install the following extensions.
- [x] `uBlock Origin` is already installed by default, which `blocks ADS` everywher.
- [x] `Canvas Blocker` which blocks sites from trying to fingerprint your device.
- [x] `Clear URLS` which removes tracking elements from Urls.
- [x] `Decentraleyes` which protects you from tracking via free CDNs.
- [x] `DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials` which prevents tracking as well as grade sites in terms of their privacy practices.
- [x] `I don't care about cookies` which blocks pop-ups from sites asking you to accept cookies.
- [x] `User-Agent Switcher and Manager` which allows you to fake the identity of your machine including its Operating System as well as the browser itself.
